    " ## 1.Collecting Data\n",
    " \n",
    "The dataset that I will be investigating is the archive of tweets from Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a funny comment about the dog. The WeRateDogs Twitter account has over 4 million subscribers and received international media coverage. This means that there is a large amount of data generated by this Twitter account. There are three sets of data that make up the WeRateDogs twitter account data and they include : twitter_archive data, image_predictions data and twitter_api data.The efforts to extract the data from these different sources is documented as follows\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- ### Collecting the Twitter archive data\n",
    "I downloaded the twitter_archive_enhanced.csv file from the udacity website and read the data using pandas read_csv function. I then imported it into the df_archive dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Collecting the image predictions data \n",
    "I downloaded the image_predictions.tsv data set from the udacity website using python's requests library and imported the data to the img_pred dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Collecting the twitter api data \n",
    "I downloaded the twitter_api data from the udacity website and using the pandas read_json function. I then imported the data to the df_api dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Assessing Data\n",
    "Through programmatic and visual assessment, I was able to identify 8 quality and 2 tidiness issues from the data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programmatic assessment(Quality Issues)\n",
    "I employed the use of python functions: info(), value_counts(), dtypes, shape, duplicated() and isnull() to identify various issues in the dataframes. These helpful functions helped in identifying the 8 quality issues as listed below: \n",
    "\n",
    "- There were some missing values.\n",
    "- Timestamp was in the wrong data fromat.\n",
    "- Tweet_id was of the wrong data type. It should be a string.\n",
    "- There were some unnecessary columns.\n",
    "- Some column names were very vague in description.\n",
    "- The first letter of some names were in lowercase.\n",
    "- The api dataframe had 2354 entries while the archive data set had 2356 entries(Which meant that there were some missing values in the retweet and favourite count).\n",
    "- There were some rating denominators that were more than the standard limit of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual assessment(Tidiness issues)\n",
    "By opening the twitter_archive_enhanced.csv and image_predictions.tsv in google sheets, I was able to visually identify some flaws in the data sets. The Tidiness issues observed were:\n",
    "- The 3 dataframes were scattered and a merge wass necessary.\n",
    "- The doggo, floofer, pupper and puppo classifications werre unnecessary and should be in one column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.Cleaning Data\n",
    "First, I ,merged the 3 dataframes into one dataframe 'raw-df'. I then saved a copy of the dataframe and named it 'new_df'. It was this dataframe(new_df) that I performed the cleaning operations on. I used the Define, Code , Test method to effectively cleanse the data of the quality and Tidiness issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.Data Storage\n",
    "After cleaning the data, I saved it all in a csv file named 'twitter_archive_master.csv'.\n",
